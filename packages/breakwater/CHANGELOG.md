# @proofoftech/breakwater

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 5011013: Fetch-level egress enforcement. `createConnector()` now hands `execute`/`dryRunExecute` a third argument, `ConnectorRuntime`, whose `fetch` is bound to the manifest's declared `egress`: every actual request — redirect hops included — must resolve to a declared host or it is denied (`ConnectorPolicyError`, policy `egress-fetch`) and audited before any bytes leave. Redirects are followed manually with a per-hop allowlist check, credential headers are stripped on cross-origin hops, non-http(s) schemes and unparseable URLs fail closed, and a manifest with no `egress` gets a fetch that denies everything. New exports: `egressFetch()` (standalone guard factory), `EgressDeniedError`, the structural fetch seam types (`EgressResponse`, `EgressRequestInit`, `EgressFetchBase`, `EgressGuardedFetch`, `EgressDenial`, `EgressFetchOptions`, `EgressResponseHeaders`), `ConnectorRuntime`, `ConnectorPolicies.fetch` (base-fetch injection seam for tests/instrumentation), and `egressDomainAllowed` (the shared host matcher). Existing connectors are unaffected — the third argument is additive and two-parameter `execute` implementations keep compiling; traffic that does not go through `runtime.fetch` (e.g. a vendor SDK's own HTTP stack) keeps the previous declaration-only posture, documented in `CONNECTORS.md`.

### Patch Changes

- df413da: `egressFetch` now releases each intermediate redirect response before following it or throwing. The manual redirect follower cancels the discarded 3xx's body stream, so a followed, hop-capped, egress-denied, or one-shot-refused redirect can no longer retain its connection until GC (Node/Undici, workerd) under sustained redirected traffic. Disposal is best-effort (a locked/errored stream's cancel rejection and an injected transport's synchronous throw are both swallowed) and never touches the response returned to the caller.
- 4fbc0be: Reviewed cleanup batch across the egress guard, tenant-id primitives, and approval self-decision paths - no observable contract changes and all 1119+ tests preserved.

  breakwater (patch): the egress host matcher and the allowlist validator are each a single shared definition (domainAllowed + assertEgressHostList, both driven by the one egressDomainAllowed match semantics), the normalized allowlist is computed once per construction instead of per hop, and the per-connector egress guard is built once at createConnector. egressFetch also treats an async-iterable (Node Readable) request body as one-shot so a 307/308 redirect no longer re-sends a consumed body, validates maxRedirects at construction, and fails closed on a browser opaque status-0 redirect response.

  flowsafe (minor): the tenant-salted ownership predicate and the id-mint rigor are hoisted into tenantOwnsSaltedId / assertMintableTenantId / mintSaltedId in do-runner/path-safe-id, and every live copy (runId and memory ownership, plus the approval write-path INV-1 belt) routes through them; mintSaltedId validates the tenant before evaluating a lazy suffix, so a caller-supplied uuid callback (mintThreadId's) can no longer run its side effects or throw ahead of the INV-3/reserved rejection. purgeTenant runs its three agent-memory deletes concurrently. The self-decision policy is threaded through createTenantResolver so TenantContext.canSelfDecide(role) is the single display hint the /workflows echo reads, and parseSelfDecision is memoized per deployment value. TenantContext gains a required canSelfDecide(role) member, BREAKING for hand-built TenantContext implementations (contexts from createTenantResolver get it automatically), hence the minor bump.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 94d6b84: Content inspection, metrics adapter, notification seam, and queue triage.

  breakwater: `piiSecrets()` joins the policy engine — regex + entropy + Luhn PII/secret detectors (email, ssn, phone, creditCard, awsAccessKey, privateKey, jwt, secretAssignment, highEntropy) with allowlist exemptions, incremental streaming-window scanning, and zero-leak hold-back hints; `classifierPolicy()` is the pluggable async-classifier seam (streaming cadence, authoritative result-phase gate, fail-closed timeout). `metricsAuditSink()` + `combineAuditSinks()` adapt the audit stream onto any counters/histograms client via the `MetricsRecorder` interface.

  flowsafe: `ApprovalNotificationSink` — the notification transport seam (fired on created records and SLA escalations, contained fire-and-forget, failures audited as `approval.notify`) threaded through `ApprovalService`, `sweepSLA`, and the host-kit assembly; approval list filters `requestedBy` + `createdBefore`/`createdAfter` (strict chronological bounds on both store backends and the HTTP surface); `ApprovalService.decideBatch` + `POST /api/approvals/batch/decide` — one decision fanned out over up to 100 records through the existing per-record CAS/SoD/audit path, partial failure reported in the envelope; dashboard triage — `FilterBar`, batch selection with derived pruning, `decideSelected`, and the `Checkbox`/`Select` slots (OPTIONAL members of `ApprovalUIComponents`, so full-interface adapters written before 0.2.0 keep compiling; the provider merge fills them from `htmlComponents`, and views consume the new `ResolvedApprovalUIComponents`); `createFlowsafeWorker()` — the composed production Worker (fetch pipeline, two-cron maintenance dispatch, audit-export consumer) the deploy template and showcase host now consume as thin shells; a react-18 peer-floor typecheck probe for the emitted approval-ui types. SPDX license headers on every source file in both packages.

### Patch Changes

- 3bed052: Harden the 0.1.0 cut against the three audit residuals:

  - **breakwater (D2):** bind idempotency `put`/`release` to an opaque reservation
    lease token minted by `reserve()` (rotated on a stale-pending takeover), so a
    slow holder that was taken over as stale can no longer delete or finalize the
    new holder's claim.
  - **flowsafe (D3):** a bare tenant `ApprovalStore.list()` / `ApprovalService.list()`
    / `GET /api/approvals` now defaults to `MAX_APPROVAL_LIST_LIMIT` instead of an
    unbounded scan (page complete history with an explicit `after` cursor); the
    cron SLA sweep pages the system view explicitly so no unbounded query remains.
  - **breakwater (D1):** `PolicyEngine` now rejects an object-only policy
    (`channels: ['object']` without `'answer'`) constructed without an audit sink,
    rather than silently no-op'ing under @mastra/core 1.50.0.

  Also: the approval dashboard hook re-sorts into reviewer order only when the
  filter requests it, so a FIFO/`after`-paged caller is no longer client-resorted
  against the server's paging.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-07-11

First publishable cut. Mastra safety middleware: policy engine (output channels,
deny patterns, opt-in hold-back buffering), RBAC processor, audit sink, connector
SDK (permission manifests, grant-only write approval, network-egress declaration
gate, idempotent replay with in-memory/atomic/D1 stores, fixed-window rate
limiting, dry-run, tenant isolation scoping), and approval-gated Claude Code /
Codex CLI connectors.

Publish order: this package publishes BEFORE `@proofoftech/flowsafe` (flowsafe's
`./host-kit/module` subpath types reference it as an optional peer).

Requires `@mastra/core` ^1.50.0 (peer), Node >= 22, ESM only
(`moduleResolution` `node16`/`nodenext`/`bundler`).
