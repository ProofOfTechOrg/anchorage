# @proofoftech/breakwater

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 94d6b84: Content inspection, metrics adapter, notification seam, and queue triage.

  breakwater: `piiSecrets()` joins the policy engine — regex + entropy + Luhn PII/secret detectors (email, ssn, phone, creditCard, awsAccessKey, privateKey, jwt, secretAssignment, highEntropy) with allowlist exemptions, incremental streaming-window scanning, and zero-leak hold-back hints; `classifierPolicy()` is the pluggable async-classifier seam (streaming cadence, authoritative result-phase gate, fail-closed timeout). `metricsAuditSink()` + `combineAuditSinks()` adapt the audit stream onto any counters/histograms client via the `MetricsRecorder` interface.

  flowsafe: `ApprovalNotificationSink` — the notification transport seam (fired on created records and SLA escalations, contained fire-and-forget, failures audited as `approval.notify`) threaded through `ApprovalService`, `sweepSLA`, and the host-kit assembly; approval list filters `requestedBy` + `createdBefore`/`createdAfter` (strict chronological bounds on both store backends and the HTTP surface); `ApprovalService.decideBatch` + `POST /api/approvals/batch/decide` — one decision fanned out over up to 100 records through the existing per-record CAS/SoD/audit path, partial failure reported in the envelope; dashboard triage — `FilterBar`, batch selection with derived pruning, `decideSelected`, and the `Checkbox`/`Select` slots (OPTIONAL members of `ApprovalUIComponents`, so full-interface adapters written before 0.2.0 keep compiling; the provider merge fills them from `htmlComponents`, and views consume the new `ResolvedApprovalUIComponents`); `createFlowsafeWorker()` — the composed production Worker (fetch pipeline, two-cron maintenance dispatch, audit-export consumer) the deploy template and showcase host now consume as thin shells; a react-18 peer-floor typecheck probe for the emitted approval-ui types. SPDX license headers on every source file in both packages.

### Patch Changes

- 3bed052: Harden the 0.1.0 cut against the three audit residuals:

  - **breakwater (D2):** bind idempotency `put`/`release` to an opaque reservation
    lease token minted by `reserve()` (rotated on a stale-pending takeover), so a
    slow holder that was taken over as stale can no longer delete or finalize the
    new holder's claim.
  - **flowsafe (D3):** a bare tenant `ApprovalStore.list()` / `ApprovalService.list()`
    / `GET /api/approvals` now defaults to `MAX_APPROVAL_LIST_LIMIT` instead of an
    unbounded scan (page complete history with an explicit `after` cursor); the
    cron SLA sweep pages the system view explicitly so no unbounded query remains.
  - **breakwater (D1):** `PolicyEngine` now rejects an object-only policy
    (`channels: ['object']` without `'answer'`) constructed without an audit sink,
    rather than silently no-op'ing under @mastra/core 1.50.0.

  Also: the approval dashboard hook re-sorts into reviewer order only when the
  filter requests it, so a FIFO/`after`-paged caller is no longer client-resorted
  against the server's paging.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-07-11

First publishable cut. Mastra safety middleware: policy engine (output channels,
deny patterns, opt-in hold-back buffering), RBAC processor, audit sink, connector
SDK (permission manifests, grant-only write approval, network-egress declaration
gate, idempotent replay with in-memory/atomic/D1 stores, fixed-window rate
limiting, dry-run, tenant isolation scoping), and approval-gated Claude Code /
Codex CLI connectors.

Publish order: this package publishes BEFORE `@proofoftech/flowsafe` (flowsafe's
`./host-kit/module` subpath types reference it as an optional peer).

Requires `@mastra/core` ^1.50.0 (peer), Node >= 22, ESM only
(`moduleResolution` `node16`/`nodenext`/`bundler`).
