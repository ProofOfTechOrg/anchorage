Content inspection, metrics adapter, notification seam, and queue triage.

breakwater: `piiSecrets()` joins the policy engine — regex + entropy + Luhn PII/secret detectors (email, ssn, phone, creditCard, awsAccessKey, privateKey, jwt, secretAssignment, highEntropy) with allowlist exemptions, incremental streaming-window scanning, and zero-leak hold-back hints; `classifierPolicy()` is the pluggable async-classifier seam (streaming cadence, authoritative result-phase gate, fail-closed timeout). `metricsAuditSink()` + `combineAuditSinks()` adapt the audit stream onto any counters/histograms client via the `MetricsRecorder` interface.

flowsafe: `ApprovalNotificationSink` — the notification transport seam (fired on created records and SLA escalations, contained fire-and-forget, failures audited as `approval.notify`) threaded through `ApprovalService`, `sweepSLA`, and the host-kit assembly; approval list filters `requestedBy` + `createdBefore`/`createdAfter` (strict chronological bounds on both store backends and the HTTP surface); `ApprovalService.decideBatch` + `POST /api/approvals/batch/decide` — one decision fanned out over up to 100 records through the existing per-record CAS/SoD/audit path, partial failure reported in the envelope; dashboard triage — `FilterBar`, batch selection with derived pruning, `decideSelected`, and the `Checkbox`/`Select` slots (OPTIONAL members of `ApprovalUIComponents`, so full-interface adapters written before 0.2.0 keep compiling; the provider merge fills them from `htmlComponents`, and views consume the new `ResolvedApprovalUIComponents`); `createFlowsafeWorker()` — the composed production Worker (fetch pipeline, two-cron maintenance dispatch, audit-export consumer) the deploy template and showcase host now consume as thin shells; a react-18 peer-floor typecheck probe for the emitted approval-ui types.
