Harden seven defects found in the dev whole-codebase review (2026-07-13). Every fix removes a root cause across its whole class and fails closed.

flowsafe:

- **F1 (security): close the cross-gate separation-of-duties race.** `ApprovalService.decide` now enforces the SoD guarantee from the run's own approved history instead of relying on `requestedBy` attribution: a non-exempt decider who already approved an earlier gate of the same run (any prior approval whose `decidedAt` is at or before this gate's `createdAt`) is refused. This is immune to the reconcile path filing the next gate as the system actor, which previously let one reviewer clear both gates. The approved-history read pages to exhaustion (fails closed past the list default) and the causal anchor never over-blocks independent parallel gates or a reject then re-review by the same reviewer. **Behavior change for operators:** with `allowSelfDecision` off, a single reviewer can no longer advance a sequential multi-gate run alone, and a multi-round same-step review needs a fresh reviewer per round; set `allowSelfDecision` (the demo uses `{ roles: ['admin'] }`) to permit one operator to clear multiple gates. An unparseable timestamp bars (fail-closed) rather than passing.
- **F4 (durability): pair R2 artifact deletion with the retention purge.** `FlowsafeWorkerConfig` gains an optional `artifactStore` seam that `runPurgeMaintenance` threads into the built-in purge, so each expired run's artifacts are deleted before its snapshot row (the only enumerable record of their keys). The deploy template comment now points copiers at this field instead of `extraPurgeDuties`, which runs after the rows are gone.
- **F2 (security): reject a non-string tenantId before INV-3 coercion.** A `typeof` guard now precedes `TENANT_ID_PATTERN.test` at every externally-typed site (the resolver belt, `assertMintableTenantId`, `assertTenantId`, both store constructors, and the exported `provisionTenant` and `purgeTenant`), so a non-string principal can no longer coerce to a matching slug and collapse into a shared tenant bucket.
- **F3 (availability): survive a create-vs-decide race in D1.** `D1ApprovalStore.create` retries the insert once when a concurrent decision closes the conflicting open row between the failed insert and the open-row lookup, honouring the idempotent-create contract instead of surfacing a raw unique violation.
- **F6 (correctness): validate list time bounds eagerly in memory.** Both in-memory approval-store list paths now reject an unparseable `createdBefore`/`createdAfter` even with zero matching records, matching D1.

breakwater:

- **F5 (correctness): make the high-entropy candidate floor track the configured threshold.** The candidate length floor is now derived from the effective `entropyThreshold` (`max(20, ceil(2 ** threshold))`) instead of a constant tuned to the 4.5 default, so lowering the threshold no longer silently drops short-secret detection. Default behavior is unchanged.
- **F7 (correctness): reject a connector id containing a colon at construction.** `createConnector` throws when `id` contains `:`, which would otherwise collide two distinct tuples on the shared idempotency and rate-limit store keys. No shipped id is affected.
