Add first-class execution principals so automated work stops impersonating people.

Every automated path previously fabricated a human to satisfy the one identity the platform had: the schedule tick, cron SLA maintenance, signal-provider delivery, and the suspension-reconcile bridge all minted `role: 'operator'`. That lost provenance and gave autonomous execution an operator's authority.

Breakwater's `Actor` gains an optional `kind` (`human` | `service` | `agent` | `system`, absent meaning human), and both `RBACMiddleware` and `createGuardedAgent` gain `allowedPrincipalKinds`, defaulting to `['human']`. The gate checks kind before role and does not consult the role allowlist for a non-human kind, because an automated principal carries a role only to satisfy the required field — consulting it would either admit whatever role the host projected, or force hosts to allow that role and thereby admit real humans holding it. Both the processor gate and the direct-call gate enforce it. **An existing agent therefore denies every automated principal without a config change.**

Flowsafe adds `ExecutionPrincipal`, with `purpose` required on every automated kind, and persists it in agent-run state and approval resume targets. `AgentMeta.allowedAutomation` declares which principal kinds may enter on which entry paths; absent or empty denies all automated entry, and an optional host authorizer can only narrow it further. `ApprovalActor` is unchanged and still means an authenticated human at the HTTP boundary or a reviewer deciding an approval — a human approval never transfers the decider's authority into the resumed run.

`ApprovalService` gains `createAsPrincipal` and `supersedeStaleAsPrincipal` for trusted platform bridges. They replace the human role gate with a kind-and-tenant check rather than widening it. There is deliberately no principal-taking `decide`, `claim`, or `delegate`.

Audit correlation now carries `principalKind`, `principalId`, `purpose`, and `delegatedBy` alongside the existing tenant, run, thread, and entry-path fields.

The principal travels to a Durable Object in a new trusted `x-flowsafe-principal` header that `createThreadTopology` stamps on every send and forward. A thread DO refuses a request that carries none rather than treating the caller as a human, and `createTenantResolver` refuses the header on inbound requests exactly as it does the tenant, actor, and role headers.

BREAKING for in-flight state, deliberately and without an upgrade path: `AgentRunRecord` is version 2 and `agent-thread` resume targets now store an `ExecutionPrincipal`. Records written by the previous release fail closed, so a suspended agent run started before this upgrade cannot resume. A version-1 record cannot be upgraded honestly — a `schedule.fire` run stored `role: 'operator'`, so reading it back as a human would launder exactly the authority this change removes. Flowsafe's breakwater peer floor moves to `>=0.7.0`.
